# Project background

CFEIntact originated as a fork of [HIVIntact](https://github.com/ramics/HIVIntact), initially developed by Imogen Wright et al. This project owes its foundational concept to the original work and appreciates the efforts put in by the original team in advancing the field of HIV research.

However, over time, CFEIntact has undergone significant modifications and enhancements to better meet our evolving needs. These changes have led the project to diverge in ways that the original HIVIntact paper no longer accurately describes the forked version. CFEIntact has introduced new features, optimizations, and methodologies that are distinct from its origin, catering to a broader spectrum of analyses.

We encourage users and contributors to view CFEIntact as an extension and evolution of the ideas first introduced in HIVIntact, adjusted and expanded upon to serve contemporary research purposes.
