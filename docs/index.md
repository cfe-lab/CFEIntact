# Welcome to HIVIntact's documentation!

HIVIntact is a python-based program that characterises genomic defects in NFL HIV-1 sequences,
allowing putative intact genomes to be identified in-silico.

HIVIntact stands out from other applications in its ability to seamlessly integrate into existing sequence-analysis pipelines.
This makes it an ideal tool for analyzing large next-generation sequencing datasets.
By incorporating HIVIntact into your workflow, you can:
- Identify intact genomes: HIVIntact utilizes algorithms for identification of intact genomes within NFL HIV-1 sequences.
- Enhance efficiency: By integrating HIVIntact into your existing sequence-analysis pipelines,
  you can streamline your workflow and save time.
- Scale up: HIVIntact is designed to handle large next-generation sequencing datasets,
  allowing you to analyze vast amounts of data with ease.
