# Welcome to CFEIntact's documentation!

CFEIntact is BCCfE's version of [HIVIntact](https://github.com/ramics/HIVIntact) -- a python-based program for characterisation of genomic defects in NFL HIV-1 sequences, allowing putative intact genomes to be identified in-silico.

CFEIntact stands out from other applications in its ability to seamlessly integrate into existing sequence-analysis pipelines.
This makes it an ideal tool for analyzing large next-generation sequencing datasets.
By incorporating CFEIntact into your workflow, you can:
- Identify intact genomes: CFEIntact utilizes algorithms for identification of intact genomes within NFL HIV-1 sequences.
- Enhance efficiency: By integrating CFEIntact into your existing sequence-analysis pipelines,
  you can streamline your workflow and save time.
- Scale up: CFEIntact is designed to handle large next-generation sequencing datasets,
  allowing you to analyze vast amounts of data with ease.
